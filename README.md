# Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) and the Notebooks of Jean-Henri Polier de Vernand (1715-1791)

Since 2021, the [Archives cantonales vaudoises (ACV)](https://www.vd.ch/toutes-les-autorites/archives-cantonales-vaudoises-acv) and the [Collège des Humanités Digitales (CDH) at EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdh/fr/) – more precisely the [Lausanne Time Machine project](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdh/lausanne-time-machine/fr/lausanne-time-machine/) – are collaborating to digitalized the notebooks of Jean-Henri Polier de Vernand. 

For my master's thesis, I applied Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) technology – using TensorFlow, [Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/) and [HTR-Flor](https://github.com/arthurflor23/handwritten-text-recognition) – to the 26'300 pages that make up the notebooks of Lausanne's bailiff lieutenant. 

This was a part of my Master degree in [Digital Humanities](https://www.unil.ch/lettres/fr/home/menuinst/formations/master-en-humanites-numeriques.html) and [History](https://www.unil.ch/hist/fr/home/menuinst/formations/maitrise-universitaire-1.html) at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. 

This git presents both the results of this research and the methodology used to transform this valuable source of Lausanne's eighteenth-century history into a digital format.

## Jean-Henri Polier de Vernand (1715-1791)
Lausanne in 1715 and served there from 1754 until his death in 1791 as lieutenant baillival of Lausanne, thus acting as a substitute for the Bernese bailli [^1] . A member of two Lausanne Councils, the Baillivale Court, the Court of Fiefs, the Criminal Court of the Castle, the Court of the Chapter and a member of the Court of the Rue de Bourg through his status as a landowner, he was one of the most important figures in Lausanne society of his time[^2]. Moreover, Polier kept numerous notebooks from 1754 until his death, in which he methodically transcribed his personal day-to-day life on more than 26,300 pages, thereby creating one of the "most important documents in the history of Lausanne"[^3].
