# HANDWRITTEN TEXT RECOGNITION (HTR) AND THE NOTEBOOKS OF JEAN-HENRI POLIER DE VERNAND (1715-1791)

From 2021, the Archives cantonales vaudoises (ACV) and the Collège des Humanités digitales (CDH) at EPFL are collaborating to digitalized the notebooks of Jean-Henri Polier de Vernand. As part of the Master's degree in Digital Humanities and the Master's degree in History at the University of Lausanne, my thesis work consisted of the handwritten text recognition (HTR) of the 26,300 pages that make up the notebooks of Lausanne's bailiff lieutenant. This git presents both the results of this research and the methodology used to transform this valuable source of Lausanne's eighteenth-century history into a digital format.
