# HANDWRITTEN TEXT RECOGNITION (HTR) AND THE NOTEBOOKS OF JEAN-HENRI POLIER DE VERNAND (1715-1791)

Since 2021, the [Archives cantonales vaudoises (ACV)](https://www.vd.ch/toutes-les-autorites/archives-cantonales-vaudoises-acv) and the [Collège des Humanités digitales (CDH) at EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdh/fr/) – more precisely the [Lausanne Time Machine project](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdh/lausanne-time-machine/fr/lausanne-time-machine/) –  are collaborating to digitalized the notebooks of Jean-Henri Polier de Vernand. 

As part of the Master's degree in [Digital Humanities](https://www.unil.ch/lettres/fr/home/menuinst/formations/master-en-humanites-numeriques.html) and the [Master's degree in History](https://www.unil.ch/hist/fr/home/menuinst/formations/maitrise-universitaire-1.html) at the University of Lausanne, my thesis work consisted of the handwritten text recognition (HTR) – using TensorFlow and [HTR-Flor](https://github.com/arthurflor23/handwritten-text-recognition) –  of the 26,300 pages that make up the notebooks of Lausanne's bailiff lieutenant. This git presents both the results of this research and the methodology used to transform this valuable source of Lausanne's eighteenth-century history into a digital format.

## Jean-Henri Polier de Vernand (1715-1791)
Lausanne in 1715 and served there from 1754 until his death in 1791 as lieutenant baillival of Lausanne, thus acting as a substitute for the Bernese bailli [^1] . A member of two Lausanne Councils, the Baillivale Court, the Court of Fiefs, the Criminal Court of the Castle, the Court of the Chapter and a member of the Court of the Rue de Bourg through his status as a landowner, he was one of the most important figures in Lausanne society of his time[^2]. Moreover, Polier kept numerous notebooks from 1754 until his death, in which he methodically transcribed his personal day-to-day life on more than 26,300 pages, thereby creating one of the "most important documents in the history of Lausanne"[^3].
